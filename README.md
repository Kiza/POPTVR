#ICU Ventilator Modeling via Neuro-fuzzy System

This is a console based program developed with .NET Framework 4 in C#.

#ABSTRACT
Fuzzy Neural Network has been widely used for software in planning, control and decision making. Meanwhile, expert systems have been implemented for medical diagnosis and medical treatment devices including life-critical devices such as medical ventilator. About 87% of ventilator-related deaths and injuries are caused by human error due to inadequate orientation or training process for the operating staff. This paper examined the possibility of modeling medical ventilator with R-POPTVR fuzzy neural network, and provided a flexible software implementation for R-POPTVR architecture. 

#ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I am sincerely grateful to School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University for giving me this wonderful chance to be a part of this project. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Assoc Prof Quek Hiok Chai for his encouragement, guidance and trust throughout the project.

My grateful thanks go to Miss Yu Junjiao Hannah, a nurse staff from Singapore General Hospital, for her valuable information on medical ventilator.
